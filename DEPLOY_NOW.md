# 🚀 Ready to Deploy - Follow These Steps!

## ✅ Status Check

- [x] **Backend deployed** to Google Apps Script
- [x] **config.js updated** with your API URL
- [x] **Debug mode enabled** (good for testing!)
- [x] **Git repository initialized**
- [x] **Initial commit created**

---

## 📤 Next: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `clippings-inventory` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Deep Roots Landscape Inventory Management System"
4. Choose: **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/thehaulbrooks/Desktop/ClippingV2/netlify-deploy

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clippings-inventory.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

#### Alternative: Using SSH

If you have SSH set up:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/clippings-inventory.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🌐 Then: Deploy to Netlify (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Connect GitHub to Netlify

1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Log in (or sign up - it's free!)
3. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
4. Click **"Deploy with GitHub"**
5. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
6. Find and select your `clippings-inventory` repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Netlify should auto-detect the settings, but verify:

```
Branch to deploy:     main
Base directory:       (leave empty)
Build command:        (leave empty)
Publish directory:    .
```

### Step 3: Deploy!

1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait ~30 seconds for deployment
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://gleaming-parfait-12345.netlify.app`

---

## 🎉 You're Live!

Once deployed:

1. **Click the URL** Netlify gives you
2. **Test the search** - Try: "Do we have mulch?"
3. **Test updates** - Add a test item
4. **Check your Google Sheet** - The item should appear!

---

## 🎨 Customize Your URL (Optional)

In Netlify:
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **"Options"** → **"Edit site name"**
3. Enter: `deeproots-inventory` (or your choice)
4. New URL: `https://deeproots-inventory.netlify.app`

---

## 🔄 Making Updates Later

After initial deployment, any time you want to update:

```bash
cd /Users/thehaulbrooks/Desktop/ClippingV2/netlify-deploy

# Make your changes to index.html, app.js, etc.

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```

Netlify will **automatically rebuild and deploy** in ~30 seconds!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If "git push" asks for credentials:

**Option A - HTTPS (Easier):**
```bash
# GitHub will prompt for username and password
# Use a Personal Access Token as password (not your GitHub password!)
# Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

**Option B - SSH (Recommended):**
```bash
# Set up SSH keys first
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Then add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Change remote to SSH:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/clippings-inventory.git
git push
```

### If Netlify build fails:

1. Check the **Deploy log** in Netlify
2. Make sure all files are in the repository
3. Verify `netlify.toml` exists in the root
4. Try deploying again

### If API calls fail:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
2. Look for errors (Debug mode is enabled!)
3. Verify the API URL in config.js is correct
4. Test the API URL directly in browser - should load a page

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/thehaulbrooks/Desktop/ClippingV2/netlify-deploy

# Check status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your message"

# Push to GitHub
git push

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# View remote URL
git remote -v
```

## 🎓 What Happens After Push

```
Local → GitHub → Netlify → Live Site

1. You push code to GitHub
   ↓
2. Netlify detects the push (webhook)
   ↓
3. Netlify builds the site (~10 seconds)
   ↓
4. Netlify deploys to CDN (worldwide)
   ↓
5. Your site is live!
```
